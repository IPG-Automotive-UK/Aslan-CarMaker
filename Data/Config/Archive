# General Information
#
# To make use of the CarMaker archiving functionality, the following
# requirements must be met:
# 1. Archiving has to be switched on in the CarMaker GUI ('Settings' menu).
# 2. An archival configuration file Data/Config/Archive must exist.
#    The same filename conventions as for other files in the Data/Config
#    directory apply (e.g. SimParameters vs. SimParameters.<hostname>).
#
# The current testrun will be archived at the end of the simulation,
# but only if at least one simulation result file was created.
# The configured result file name also determines the archive name.


# Format - File format of the resulting testrun archive.
#
# Available formats are dir, tgz and zip.
# The dir format collects all files in a directory, both tgz and zip
# pack everything into an archive file of the respective format instead.
# Suggested format is zip under MS Windows, tgz on all other systems.

# Format = tgz


# FlatArchive - Put all files into a flat archive.
#
# If set to yes, the resulting testrun archive will consist of a
# single directory containing all archived files.
# If set to no, the resulting testrun archive will preserve the
# directory structure of the files to be archived.
# Default is no, i.e. the directory structure is preserved.

FlatArchive = no


# CheckAccess - Check access time of files to be archived.
#
# If set to yes, only files that seem to be accessed by the simulation
# program during the current testrun are put into the archive. This
# makes it possible to specify a superset of all possibly relevant files
# to be archived, yet only the files actually used in the current testrun
# will be archived, thus saving disk space.
# If set to no, file are put into the archive independently of their
# current file access time.
# Default is no, file access time is NOT checked.

CheckAccess = no


# Files - List of files to be archived after a testrun.
#
# The list of files must contain one line per file to be archived,
# each line indented by a tab character. The following rules apply:
#
# - Paths may be absolute or relative to the project directory.
#
# - If an entry starts with an exclamation mark '!', the file access
#   time for the specified file will not be checked.
#
# - Filenames with wildcards are allowed, e.g. an entry like !src/*
#   archives all files in the src directory with the testrun.
#
# - References to non-existent files will be silently ignored.
#
# - The following shortcuts are recognized and automatically replaced
#   with the appropriate path (case is ignored for shortcuts):
#	SimParameters (*)
#       EcuParameters
#       OutputQuantities
#       InputFromFile
#       Archive
#       TestrunComplete (= Testrun + the following shortcuts)
#           Testrun (*)
#           Road
#           Tires
#           Trailer
#           UserDriver
#           VehicleControl
#       VehicleComplete (= vehicle + the following shortcuts)
#           Vehicle (*)
#           Brake
#           Steering
#           Suspensions
#           Suspextforces
#           Powertrain
#           PT.Engine
#           PT.Clutch
#           PT.Gearbox
#           PT.Driveline
#	TrailerComplete (= trailer + the following shortcuts)
#           Trailer (*)
#           TrBrake
#           TrSuspensions
#           TrSuspextforces
#           TrTires
#
# The default contains all shortcuts marked with (*) in the above list.
